    <p>Your task is to negotiate a potential agreement on the price for 1000 kg of Robusta coffee beans. <b>The average price in the market is $1.5/kg.</b> You can make the offer within a <b>50% (+/-)</b> variation of the market average price. The quantity of 1000kg (01 ton) is no need to negotiate.</p>
    <p>You have 20 minutes to negotiate in this section. You and the seller can freely exchange offers and messages with one another by chatting. The game ends when both parties reach an agreement or time runs out (even both parties donâ€™t agree with any offer yet).</p>
    <p><b>Please send messages with your suggested price in the chat box below. You can openly communicate with your partner by greeting and exchanging messages to advantage your position.</b></p>
    <p><b>Please state your initial offer (from $0.75 to $2.25):</b></p>
