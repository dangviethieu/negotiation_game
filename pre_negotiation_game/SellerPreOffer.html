    <p>
        <u>Background information:</u>
            You are the director of Queen Coffee ltd, one of the largest groups involved in the production, processing and distribution of Robusta coffee in the market. Viha company, a wholesaler distributing raw coffee products to coffee shops, is very interested in purchasing Robusta coffee beans from your company because the market is in high demand of this type of coffee. Assuming that only qualified buyers can get access to the purchase of the coffee bean type in the market under regulation, you as the seller have an implicit power to decide a list of qualified buyers.
        <br>
        <u>The product:</u> 01 ton (1000kg) of Robusta Coffee.
        <br>
        <u>Pre-negotiation stage:</u>
            Seller has a power to finalise a list of qualified buyers and decide to sell the product or not. As the negotiator representing the seller, therefore, you can be offered a bribe to award the purchase to Viha company. You have to make a decision whether you will receive the bribery. You have three options to decide in the stage:
        <ul>
            <li>The buyer does not offer any bribe. You will decide (1) to continue the negotiation or (2) to end the negotiation;</li>
            <li>The buyer offers a lump sum of bribe from $0 to $100. You will decide (1) to accept the bribe amount the buyer has offered; or (2) to give a counter-offer, but the buyer can either accept or reject this counteroffer; or (3) to reject the bribe-receiving and end the negotiation;</li>
            <li>The buyer offers a percentage as 2%; or 5%; or 10% of the contract value added to the price of the product. You will decide (1) to accept the bribe the buyer has offered; or (2) to give a counter-offer, but the buyer can either accept or reject this counteroffer; or (3) to reject the bribe-receiving and end the negotiation;</li>
        </ul>
