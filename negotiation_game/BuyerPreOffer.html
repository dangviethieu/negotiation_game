        <u>Background information:</u>
            You are the purchasing manager of Viha company, a wholesaler distributing raw coffee products to coffee shops in your country. Your company is very interested in purchasing Robusta coffee beans because the market is in high demand of this type of coffee. However, only qualified buyers can get access to the purchase of the coffee bean type in the market under regulation. Queen Coffee Ltd is one of the largest groups involved in the production, processing and distribution of Robusta coffee in the market, and the seller has an implicit power to decide a list of qualified buyers.
        <u>The product:</u> 01 ton (1000kg) of Robusta Coffee.
        <u>Pre-negotiation stage:</u>
            The Seller has a power to finalise a list of qualified buyers and decide to sell the product or not. As the negotiator representing the buyer, you have to make a decision whether using bribery to increase the chance of the purchase. In other words, you have three options to decide in the stage:
        <ul>
            <li>Not to offer any bribe;</li>
            <li>Offer a fixed sum from 0 to $100. As the chief negotiator of your company, you have the discretion to decide how much you are offering the director of Queen Coffee (the seller negotiator);</li>
            <li>Offer a percentage as 2%; or 5%; or 10% of the contract value to the director of Queen Coffee. The percentage is added to the price that your company pays to increase the chance of the purchase. You have to decide what percentage you are offering the director of Queen Coffee (e.g. 2%, or 5%, or 10%).</li>
        </ul>
        If you choose to offer a bribe, your partner will: (1) accept the offer you have suggested; or (2) give a counter-offer that you can either accept or reject; or (3) reject it and end the negotiation.
        If you choose not to offer a bribe, your partner could: (1) go about the negotiation of the contract without a bribe; or (2) choose to end the negotiation.
